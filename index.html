    <p>
      Oddly enough, the original pastry that inspired today‚Äôs typical butter
      croissants (croissants au beurre) bear only a moderate resemblance to the
      ones we gobble down today‚Ä¶
    </p>
    <p>
      Croissants are a style of viennoiserie pastries, which of course relates
      back to the Austrian city of Vienna, otherwise known as the birthplace of
      croissants.
    </p>
    <p>
      The ancestor to the modern-day croissant was called the kipferl, which
      dates back to the 13th century and comes in various shapes and sizes. They
      are often filled with nuts or other fillings, and kipferl (which have
      possible but unconfirmed roots in ancient Egypt), are also considered to
      be a form of rugelach, a Jewish pastry of Ashkenazic origin. They are
      denser and sweeter to what we think of as the modern croissant.
    </p>
    <p>
      Around the turn of the 17th century, that dough began to change, and the
      style of dough used in traditional croissants was first documented. How it
      morphed into the traditional croissant, though, is still a part of
      culinary lore...
